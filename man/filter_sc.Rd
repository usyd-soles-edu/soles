\usage{
filter_sc(
  data,
  uos_filter = NULL,
  session_filter = NULL,
  year_filter = NULL,
  mode_filter = NULL,
  location_filter = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, typically the output of \code{\link{parse_sc}}.}

\item{uos_filter}{Optional. A character string specifying the Unit of Study code to filter by (e.g., "ENVX2001"). Renamed from \code{uos} to avoid conflict with the new column.}

\item{session_filter}{Optional. A character string specifying the session code to filter by (e.g., "S1C"). Renamed from \code{session}.}

\item{year_filter}{Optional. A numeric or character string specifying the year to filter by (e.g., 2025). Renamed from \code{year}.}

\item{mode_filter}{Optional. A character string specifying the mode code to filter by (e.g., "ND"). Renamed from \code{mode}.}

\item{location_filter}{Optional. A character string specifying the location code to filter by (e.g., "CC"). Renamed from \code{location}.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the special consideration data, potentially filtered,
with the \code{uo_s_availability} column split into \code{uos}, \code{session}, \code{year}, \code{mode}, and \code{location}.
Returns the original data frame (with split columns) if no filtering arguments are provided.
Returns the original unmodified data frame if the availability column is not found.
}
\description{
Filters a data frame containing special consideration data based on components
extracted from the availability column.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'sc_data' is the output from parse_sc()
# Split columns and filter by UoS and Session
filtered_data <- filter_sc(sc_data, uos_filter = "ENVX2001", session_filter = "S1C")
# Split columns and filter by Year and Mode
specific_year_mode <- filter_sc(sc_data, year_filter = 2025, mode_filter = "ND")
# Just split columns without filtering
split_only_data <- filter_sc(sc_data)
