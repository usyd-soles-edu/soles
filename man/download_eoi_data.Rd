\usage{
download_eoi_data(processed_eoi_data, save_path, uos = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{processed_eoi_data}{A named list of data frames. Each name is a unit
code, and each data frame contains the processed EOI data for that unit.
This is typically the output from \code{\link{process_eoi_data}}.}

\item{save_path}{A character string; the path to the main output
directory where unit-specific subdirectories and CSV files will be created.
If \code{NULL}, a warning is logged and no files are saved.}

\item{uos}{Optional. A character vector of unit of study codes. If provided,
only data for these units will be saved. If NULL (default), all data is saved.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. This function is used for its side
effect of writing files.
}
\description{
Saves a list of data frames (processed EOI data), each corresponding to a
unit of study, into separate CSV files. Files are organized into
subdirectories named after sanitized unit codes, within a specified save path.
