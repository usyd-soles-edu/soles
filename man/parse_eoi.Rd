\description{
Reads an EOI CSV file, extracts relevant columns, and renames them
according to a predefined schema. The function expects a specific CSV
structure where actual headers are on the second row and data starts
from the fourth row. The first 17 columns (based on the headers from
the second row) are discarded.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming an EOI_data.csv file exists in the working directory
# with the expected structure.
# eoi_data <- parse_eoi("EOI_data.csv")
# print(head(eoi_data))
}
