}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame, typically the output of \code{\link[=process_paycodes]{process_paycodes()}}. This
data frame may have a \code{"has_changes"} attribute (logical) to indicate
whether changes have been detected compared to a previous version. If this

\description{
This function takes the output from \code{\link[=process_paycodes]{process_paycodes()}} and writes it to a
CSV file. The output file is automatically named with a timestamp and the
original roster filename, and saved in a 'logs' subdirectory relative to the
original roster file.
